1. **Bronze Layer:** Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer:** This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer:** Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## Project Overview
This project involves:

- **Data Architecture:** Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
- **ETL Pipelines:** Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
- **Data Modeling:** Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

## Important Tools
- **Datasets:** Access to the project dataset (csv files).
- **SQL Server Express:** Lightweight server for hosting your SQL database.
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):** GUI for managing and interacting with databases.
- **Git Repository:** Set up a GitHub account and repository to manage, version, and collaborate on your code efficiently.
- **DrawIO:** Design data architecture, models, flows, and diagrams.
- **Notion:** Get the Project Template from Notion
  
## Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
